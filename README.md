###BAMAZON with Node.js & MySQL
<br>
#Overview of BAMAZON
<br>
I created an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills learned in this unit. The app takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory.  For data input and storage, the app requires MySQL and Inquirer npm packages in the files.
